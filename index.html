              Our "thirty-is-the-new-twenty" culture tells us that the
              twentysomething years don't matter. Some say they are an extended
              adolescence. Others call them an emerging adulthood. But thirty is
              not the new twenty.

              This is a book about self-sabotage. Why we do it, when we do it,
              and how to stop doing it—for good. Coexisting but conflicting
              needs create self-sabotaging behaviors. This is why we resist
              efforts to change, often until they feel completely futile.
